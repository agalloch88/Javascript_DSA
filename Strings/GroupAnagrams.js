// Write a function which takes in an array of strings and groups anagrams together.

// Anagrams are strings made up of the same letters, where order does not matter. For example,
// "cinema" and "iceman" are anagrams. Similarly, "foo" and "ofo" are anagrams.

// The function should return a list of anagram groups in no particular order.

// Sample Input:
// words = ["yo", "act", "flop", "tac", "foo", "cat", "oy", "olfp"]

// Sample Output:
// [["yo", "oy"], ["flop", "olfp"], ["act", "tac", "cat"], ["foo"]]

// Solution 1:
