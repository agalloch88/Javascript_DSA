// The problem presents two strings, stringOne and stringTwo. Write a function which determines if these two strings can be made equal using only one edit.

// There are three possible edits to make:
// * REPLACE: One character in one string is swapped for a different character.
// * ADD: One character is added at any index in one of the strings.
// * REMOVE: One character is removed at any index in one of the strings.

// Note that both strings will contain at least one character. If the strings are the same, the function should return true.

// Sample Input:
// stringOne = "hello"
// stringTwo = "hollo"

// SampleOutput:
// True
// A single replace at index one of either string will make the strings equal.

// Solution 1:
