// Write a function which, given an input string, returns its longest palindromic substring.

// A palidrome is defined as a string of characters which is written the same forward and backward. Note that, in the context of the problem, single-character strings
// are palindromes.

// For the context of the problem, assume there will only be one longest palindromic substring.

// Sample Input:
// string = "abaxyzzyxf"

// Sample Output:
// "xyzzyx"

// Solution 1:
