// Write a function which takes in a sorted array of integers, as well as a target integer. The function should use a variation of the Binary Search algorithm to find a range of 
// indices in between which the target number is contained in the array, and should this range in the form of an array.

// The first number in the output array should represent the first index at which the target number is located, while the second number should represent the last index at
// which the target number is located. The function should return [-1, -1] if the integer is not contained at all in the array.

// Sample Input:
// array = [0, 1, 21, 33, 45, 45, 45, 45, 45, 45, 61, 71, 73]
// target = 45

// Sample Output:
// [4, 9]

// Solution 1
