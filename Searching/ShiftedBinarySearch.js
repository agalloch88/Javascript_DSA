// Write a function which takes in a sorted array of distinct integers, as well as a target integer. The caveat for the problem at hand is that the integers in the array
// are shifted by some amount. In other words, the integers are moved to the left or to the right by one or more positions. For example, [1, 2, 3, 4] might turn into [3, 4, 1, 2].

// The function should use a variation of the Binary Search algorithm to determine if the target interger exists in the array, and should return its index if so. Otherwise,
// the function should return -1.

// Sample Input:
// array = [45, 61, 71, 72, 73, 0, 1, 21, 33, 37]
// target = 33

// Sample Output:
// 8
