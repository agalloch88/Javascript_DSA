// The problem presents two sorted arrays of integers, called arrayOne and arrayTwo. Write a function which returns the median of these arrays.

// For the purposes of the problem, assume both arrays have at least one value. However, they could be of different lengths. If the median is a decimal value, it should not be rounded,
// beyond the inevitable rounding of floating point math.

// Sample Input:

// arrayOne = [1, 3, 4, 5]
// arrayTwo = [2, 3, 6, 7]

// Sample Output:

// 3.5, where the combined array is [1, 2, 3, 3, {median here} 4, 5, 6, 7]

// Solution 1:
