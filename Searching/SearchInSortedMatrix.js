// The problem presents a two-dimensional array (also called a matrix), which contains distinct integers, and a target integer. Each row in the matrix is sorted, and
// each column is also sorted. The matrix does not necessarily have the same height and width.

// Write a function which returns an array of the row and column indi9ces of the target integer, if said integer is actually found within the matrix.
// If it is not found, return [-1, -1].

// Sample Input:
// matrix = [
//      [1, 4, 7, 12, 15, 1000],
//      [2, 5, 19, 31, 32, 10001],
//      [3, 8, 24, 33, 35, 1002],
//      [40,, 41, 42, 44, 45, 1003],
//      [99, 100, 103, 106, 128, 1004],         
//     ]
// target = 44

// Sample Output:
// [3, 3]

// Solution 1:
