// The problem provides two positive integers, representing the height of a staircase, and the maximum number of steps someone may advance up the staircase at a time, respectively.
// Write a function which returns the number of ways in which someone may climb the staircase.

// For example, given a staircase of height = 3, and maxSteps = 2, someone could climb the staircase in 3 ways. They could take 1 step -> 1 step -> 1 step,
// or 1 step -> 2 steps, or 2 steps -> 1 step.

// Note that, for this problem, maxSteps <= height will always be true.

// Sample Input:
// height = 4
// maxSteps = 2

// Sample Output:
// 5
// The staircase could be climbed in the following ways:
// 1 -> 1 -> 1 -> 1
// 1 -> 1 -> 2
// 1 -> 2 -> 1
// 2 -> 1 -> 1
// 2 -> 2

// Solution 1:
