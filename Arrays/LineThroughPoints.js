// The problem presents an array of points plotted on a 2D graph (meaning the x/y plane). Write a function which returns the maximum number of points which a single line (or, potentially, multiple lines)
// on the graph passes through.

// The input array/list will contain  points represented by an array/list of two integers [x, y]. The input array/list will never contatin duplicate points, and will always contain at least one plotted point.

// Sample Input:

// points = [
//  [1, 1],
//  [2, 2],
//  [3, 3],
//  [0, 4],
//  [-2, 6],
//  [4, 0],
//  [2, 1],
// ]

// Sample Output:

// 4
// A plotted line will pass through the following points: [-2, 6], [0, 4], [2, 2], [4, 0]

// Solution 1:
