// Write a function which takes in an array of at least two integers, and which returns an array containing the starting and ending indices of the smallest subarray contained
// inside the input array which needs to be sorted in place in order for the entire input array to be sorted (in ascending order).

// If the input array is already sorted, the function should return [-1, -1].

// Sample Input:
// array = [1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 11, 7, 12, 6, 7, 16, 18, 19]

// Sample Output:
// [3, 9]

// Solution 1:
