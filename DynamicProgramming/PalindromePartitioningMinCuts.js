// Given a non-empty string, write a function which returns the minimum number of cuts needed to
// perform on a string such that each remaining substring is a palindrome.

// A palindrome is defined as a string which is written the same forward as backward. Note that
// for the purposes of the problem, single-character strings are palindromes.

// Sample Input:

// string = "noonabbad"

// Sample Output:

// 2
// noon | abba | d

// Solution 1:
