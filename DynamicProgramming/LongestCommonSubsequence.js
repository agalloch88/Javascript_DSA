// Write a function which takes in two strings, and returns the longest common subsequence shared between the two input strings.

// A subsequence of a string is defined as a set of characters which are not necessarily adjacent in the string, but which are in the same order as they appear in the string.
// For instance, the characters ["a", "c", "d"] form a subsequence of the string "abcd", and so do the characters ["b", "d"]. Note that a single character in a string, as well
// as the string itself, are both valid subsequences of the string.

// For the context of the problem, assume that there will be only one longest common subsequence.

// Sample Input:

// str1 = "ZXVVYZW"
// str2 = "XKYKZPW"

// Sample Output:

// ["X", "Y", "Z", "W"]
