// Given a non-empty array of integers, write a function which returns the longest strictly-increasing
// subsequence in the array.

// A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers which are not necessarily adjacent in the array,
// but are in the same order as they appear in the array. For example, the numbers [1, 3, 4] form
// a subsequence of the array [1, 2, 3, 4], and so do the numbers [2, 4]. Note that a single
// numbwer in an array, and the array itself, are both valid subsequences of the array.

// For the purposes of the problem, assume there will only be one longest increasin subsequence.

// Sample Input:

// array = [5, 7, -24, 12, 10, 2, 3, 12, 5, 6, 35]

// Sample Output:

// [-24, 2, 3, 5, 6, 35]

// Solution 1:
