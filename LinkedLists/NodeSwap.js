// Write a function which takes in the head of a Singly Linked List, swaps every pair of adjacent nodes in place (meaning, the function does not create a new Linked List)
// and which returns the new head of the Singly Linked List.

// If the input Linked List has an odd number of nodes, the final node should remain the same.

// Each `LinkedList` has an integer `value`, as well as a `next` node pointing to the next node in the list, or to None/null if it is the tail of the list.

// For the purposes of the problem, assume the input Linked List will always have at least one node. In other words, the head will never be None/null.

// Sample Input:

// head = 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5

// Sample Output:

// 1 -> 0 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5 -> 4

// Solution 1:
