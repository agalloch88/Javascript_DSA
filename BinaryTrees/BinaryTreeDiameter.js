// Write a function which takes in a Binary Tree and returns its diameter. The diameter of a Binary Tree is defined as the length of its longest path, even if that
// path does not pass through the root of the tree.

// A path is a collection of connected nodes in a tree, where no node is connected to more than two other nodes. The length of a path is the number of edges between
// the path's first node and its last node.

// Each Binary Tree node has an integer value, a left child node, and a right child node. Children nodes can either be Binary Tree nodes themselves, or None/null.

// Sample Input:
// tree =           1
//                 / \
//                3   2
//               / \
//              7   4
//             /     \
//            8       5
//           /         \
//          9           6

// Sample Output:
// 6, for the path [9, 8, 7, 3, 4, 5, 6]

// Solution 1:
