// The problem presents the root node of a Binary Tree. Write a function which returns true if this Binary Tree is height-balanced, and false if it is not.

// A Binary Tree is height-balanced if, for each node in the tree, the difference between the height of its left subtree and its right subtree is, at most, 1.

// Each Binary Tree node has an integer value, a left child node, and a right child node. Children nodes can either be Binary Tree nodes themselves, or None/null.

// Sample Input:
// tree =       1
//             / \
//            2   3
//           / \   \
//          4   5   6
//             / \
//            7   8

// Sample Output:
// true

// Solution 1:
