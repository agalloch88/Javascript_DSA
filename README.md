## Javascript Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

A repository to hold Javascript solutions for common DSA problems. The solutions are organized by problem type or data structure, and the code is automatically formatted using [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to ensure consistent, predictable coding style.

### Structure

The repository is broken up by problem type or data structure. Topics include:

Topics include:
- [Arrays](./Arrays)
- [Binary Search Trees](./BinarySearchTrees)
- [Binary Trees](./BinaryTrees)
- [Dynamic Programming](./DynamicProgramming)
- [Famous Algorithms](./FamousAlgorithms)
- [Graphs](./Graphs)
- [Greedy Algorithms](./GreedyAlgorithms)
- [Heaps](./Heaps)
- [Linked Lists](./LinkedLists)
- [Recursion](./Recursion)
- [Searching](./Searching)
- [Sorting](./Sorting)
- [Stacks](./Stacks)
- [Strings](./Strings)
- [Tries](./Tries)

### Code Formatting

This repository uses Prettier for code formatting. To format the code, run the following script:

```bash
npm run format
```

This will ensure all JavaScript files in the repository are formatted according to the Prettier configuration in the `.prettierrc` file. If you have different preferences, update the configuration file in your local version accordingly.

### Installation

To install the repository, clone it locally and install the dependencies using npm:

```bash
