// Write a function which takes a positive integer, represented as a string called number, and an integer called numDigits. Remove numDigits from the string, so that the number
// represented by the string is as large as possible afterwards.

// Note that the order of the remaining digits cannot be changed. For the purposes of the problem, assume numDigits will always the less than the length of variable number, and
// greater than or equal to 0.

// Sample Input:

// number = "462839"
// numDigits = 2

// Sample Output

// "6839"
// remove the digits 4 and 2

// Solution 1:
