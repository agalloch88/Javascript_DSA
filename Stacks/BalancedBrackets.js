// Write a function whcih takes in a string made up of brackets ( (, ), [, ], {, } ) and other optional characters. The function should return a boolean
// representing whether the string is balanced with regard to the brackets.

// A string is said to be balanced if it has as many opening brackets of a certain type as it has closing brackets of that type, and if no bracket is unmatched.
//  Note that an opening bracket cannot match a corresponding closing bracket which comes before it, and similarly, a closing bracket cannot match a 
// corresponding opening bracket which comes after it. Also, brackets cannot overlap each other, as in the examplke [(]).

// Sample Input:
// string = "([])(){}(())()()"

// Sample Output:
// true, as it is balanced

// Solution 1:
